# If you find yourself ignoring temporary files generated by your text editor
# or operating system, you probably want to add a global ignore instead:
#   git config --global core.excludesfile '~/.gitignore_global'

# Ignore bundler config.
/server/.bundle
/server/.env

# Ignore the default SQLite database.
/server/db/*.sqlite3
/db/*.sqlite3-journal

# Ignore all logfiles and tempfiles.
/server/log/*
/server/tmp/*
!/server/log/.keep
!/server/tmp/.keep

# Ignore uploaded files in development
/server/storage/*

/server/yarn-error.log

/server/public/assets
/server/.byebug_history
/tmp

# Ignore master key for decrypting credentials and more.
/server/config/master.key
